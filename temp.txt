Everyone else has already answered it, but I think I still have something else to  add;.

Reasons to have that if statement calling main() (in no particular order):

    Other languages (like C and Java) have a main() function that is called when the program is executed. Using this if, we can make Python behave like them, which feels more familiar for many people.

    Code will be cleaner, easier to read, and better organized . (yeah, I know this is subjective)

    It will be possible to import that python code as a module without nasty side-effects.

        This means it will be possible to run tests against that code.

        This means we can import that code into an interactive python shell and test/debug/run it.

    Variables inside def main are local, while those outside it are global. This may introduce a few bugs and unexpected behaviors.

But, you are not required to write a main() function and call it inside an if statement.

I myself usually start writing small throwaway scripts without any kind of function. If the script grows big enough, or if I feel putting all that code inside a function will benefit me, then I refactor the code and do it. This also happens when I write bash scripts.
